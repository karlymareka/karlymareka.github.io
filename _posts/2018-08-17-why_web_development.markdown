I love to explore and create things that transport people to other worlds, other perspectives, other ideas, other realities. 

Some people like to create with their hands. They build physical testaments to their creativity. Paintings, tables, houses, bridges. 

I have always preferred things created on the non-physical level. I feel such wonder and appreciation for a well-crafted novel, videogame, website, movie, or app. I love the feeling of being so fully immersed in an experience that I forget that it was even engineered, when it feels completely natural and organic. 

I want to build these things too. Being a consumer is no longer enough. Sure, I have toyed around with writing stories and blog posts, but I'm ready to take it to the next level, to really contribute on a professional level. I want to build things that work. 

Eventually, I would love to contribute my skills to help solve environmental problems such as climate change and plastic pollution. I believe we need more passionate technologists using code to save the planet, whether it's building an app that brings more awareness of environmental issues to the public or helping people cut down on pollution and waste, or directly working on cutting edge geoengineering technology that could aid in solving climate change.
